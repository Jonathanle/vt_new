# Goals
I just finished developing my model. In this phase, I want to be able to flexibly learn and experiment with the validation parameters for why, relating to the goal of how i can validate and fix the learning process so that I get high performance in alidation


# Insights / Goals / Paths to take 
- I see getting a familiarity with the crossfold validation and if it is correct is desired
- Documentation and creation of certainty in the areas that I believe are correct.


# Path 1 - Is the code that I am doing correct?
- I believe that it is corrrect because in the ECG Pipeline, I used the same cross validation approach, where it produced reasonable results. If it really were limiting its performance, then with the ECG pipeline, it would have done really well.
