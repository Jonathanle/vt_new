# Development Objectives


## Goal - Create a model that diagnoses VT Accuracy


## Methods 
1. Use Pretrained Model fromo Dr. Zhang's Lab to extract the segmentation maps from the images
2. Use Nivetha's previous pp flow in order to get the *exact* images 
3. Provide Methods / Infrastructural objectives for examining images + getting the images for bootstrapping certaint


1. Examine the Format of The Data and Determine How to Preprocess
2. Preprocess data into format that is clear and useful



# Details on the Preprocessing Flow 
- Given Images + Preprocessor, devise method such that at that state of "I have method" *I*  can call algorithm to transform the images into a representation such that Segmentation Model can Run through
- consider ideas related to bootstrapping explanation related to importing matfiles + using pd to import xlsx files


# From the Images and its format, there is 


#Objectives
- Get verify through testing the behavior + document its behavior of testing, using claude to test and develop


## Application Specific Problems needed to run 

`xhost +local:` --> i need to run this every time on locall - TODO: how can i auto run this the best? basahrdc seems
